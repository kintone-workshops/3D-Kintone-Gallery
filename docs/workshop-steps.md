## Get Started

First, let's download the [sean-kintone/3D-Kintone-Gallery](https://github.com/sean-kintone/3D-Kintone-Gallery) Repo and go inside the folder.

Once you are inside the folder, let's install the dependencies!

```shell
cd Downloads

git clone https://github.com/sean-kintone/3D-Kintone-Gallery

cd 3D-Kintone-Gallery

npm install

npm install -g @kintone/customize-uploader
```

## Create a Kintone Web Database App

Let's create a Kintone App with some Shapes and Sizes to display!

Here are the required fields & their configurations for our workshop:

| Field Type | Field Name | Field Code  | Note                                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Dropdown   | Shape Type | `shapeType` | Options must include `Cube` and `Torus` |
| Number     | Length     | `length`    | Length of shape                         |
| Number     | Width      | `width`     | Width of shape                          |
| Number     | Depth      | `depth`     | Depth of shape                          |

Then create a Custom View
  * From App Settings, click on the **Views** tab
  * Click on the Plus Button ‚äï to create a View
  * Select `Custom view` under **Visible Fields and Column Order** section
  * Get the `View ID`! (Required in `.env` file)
  * Under **HTML Code**, input `<div id="root"></div>`
  * Save!

Be sure to click the **Save** and **Activate App** buttons! üí™

## Create a `.env` file

Using the [.env.example](./../.env.example) file as a template, create a `.env` file that will contain your login credentials and the Kintone App's View ID.

Here is what your `.env` might look like:

```txt
KINTONE_BASE_URL="https://example.kintone.com"
KINTONE_USERNAME="example@gmail.com"
KINTONE_PASSWORD="ILoveKintone!"
VIEW_ID="1234567"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT DELETE THE [.env.example](./../.env.example) FILE!  
[.env.example](./../.env.example) is used by env-cmd to verify that `.env` file is correctly configured.

## Edit Your customize-manifest json

First, we need to tell our uploading scripts which Kintone App we will be working on.

```json
{
    "app": "23",
    "scope": "ALL",
    ...
```

![images/customize-manifest.json](images/customize-manifest.png)

We can find our App ID number easily from the URL of our Kintone App.  
Go to your Kintone App and grab the URL. It should look this: `https://devevents.kintone.com/k/36/`  
Kintone App's URL follows this template: `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.kintone.com/k/<App ID>/show#record=<RECORD ID>`  
So then the `https://devevents.kintone.com/k/36/` URL tells us that this App's ID is `36`

## Edit index js

Our example code is mostly filled in and, at first glance, looks pretty unfamiliar, but fear not! This was mostly taken directly from the [official documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene). We explain the functions and different parts of our code with comments, so make sure to read (and in the future write) the comments.

The incomplete parts of the code have been marked with TODO comments, as below.

![images/find-todos.png](images/find-todos.png)

As we already have a working `scene`, `camera`, and `lighting`, all we need are some shapes, specifically cubes & torus.
The code says that we are creating a new `box geometry`, but the values there are null. That seems like a good place to start.

What is a `geometry`? A `geometry` is the mathematical dimensions of the object we want to display -- how long is it, what is the radius, etc.
The tricky part is what a `geometry` is *not*. The `geometry` is just an invisible wireframe. In order to see our shapes, we'll have to combine them with `material` which is our "skin" around the `geometry`. Our `material` can have color, reflectivity, texture, etc.

For our geometry, how can we know what values to put in? For those of us who are used to thinking in 3D space, it might seem reasonable that a cube should have a width, length, and depth. But let's check to make sure.

First, we hover over the object to see if our IDE will tell us anything useful:

![images/check-params.png](images/check-params.png)

Here our IDE shows us the "constructor", which shows the parameters that can be used to create an object. Our cube can take width, height, length, widthSegments, heightSegments, & lengthSegments. They are all optional and are denoted with a question mark.

Great, let's pass in our dimensions:

`var cubeGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(width, length, depth);`

![images/input-variables.png](images/input-variables.png)

Our next TODO is to complete the CubeMaterial variable. Hovering with our IDE tells us that it takes a `MeshStandardMaterialParameters`, which isn't *too* helpful. Let's check the [documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=mesh#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial).

> .color : Color -- Color of the material, by default set to white (0xffffff).

It looks like our material can take a color parameter. We've used some THREE.JS tools to randomly pick a color on line 102, but you can manually pick a color using hex format.

`const cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({color: randomColor,});`

![images/input-color.png](images/input-color.png)

Definitely feel free to experiment with adding parameters listed in the documentation. THREE.JS is sometimes more of an "art" than coding, and some very fun and beautiful effects can be created with little effort.

Next, we need to combine our `geometry` with our `material` to create a `mesh`, which will get added to our `scene`.

![images/combine-mesh.png](images/combine-mesh.png)

Hovering with our IDE tells us the order our variable parameters get passed to our `mesh`: `cubeGeometry`, `cubeMaterial`.

There are some other pre-filled-in areas, which position our cube, and later spin it. After completing this workshop, we recommend checking the documentation and playing with the variables to get more comfortable with THREE.JS.

Now that our cube is completed, we must repeat the steps with our torus. We'll fill in the missing variables for our `torusGeometry` and `torusMaterial`.

`const torusGeometry = new THREE.TorusGeometry(length, width, depth, 100);`

`const torusMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({color: randomColor});`

![images/input-torus.png](images/input-torus.png)

Lastly, we combine our `torusGeometry` and `torusMaterial` into a `mesh` and add it to our scene:

`const torus = new THREE.Mesh(torusGeometry, torusMaterial);`

![images/combine-torus.png](images/combine-torus.png)

## Build & Upload the customization

With this, we can save our work and run kintone-customize-uploader!
(See the [3D_Gallery_Slides.pdf](../3D_Gallery_Slides.pdf) for more info!) Run `npm run start` in your terminal. Navigate to your app, select the gallery view we created, and enjoy your cool 3D space!

Good luck coding!
